# Flashcards

This is the third project in the React Nanodegree Program by Udacity.

The aim is to use React Native to build a mobile application (Android and iOS) that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

The project has been bootstrapped using [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Getting started

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the app with `yarn start`
* access the app on a device or emulator using [Expo](https://expo.io/)

## Tested on

* Device - Moto G5S Plus, Android 7.1.1
* Emulator - iPhone 8, iOS 11.4
